For the BirdSong LMS, as a project manager, I would do the following

1. By identifying the project scope, I would come up with the use cases of the project (based on the customer/client requirements) using UML models and create user flows to create an end to end service (Sample use case as png for BirdSong attached to the repo)

2. Create Milestones for the project on a broader level based on the use cases/ user flows identified in step 1
- Design UI/UX for each web page in every use case: Dec 1st, 2022 to Jan 1st, 2023
- Create a timeline for the development phase of the project: Jan 2nd 2023 to April 15th, 2023
- Conduct Quality Assurance and build check for the developed project: April 16, 2023 to April 30, 2023
- Release date of the version 1 of the project: May 1, 2023
- etc

3. Based on the previous experiences, further breakdown the milestones into monthly or weekly milestones
- Monthly milestones: Generate UI/UX design: Dec 1st, 2022 to Jan 1st, 2023
- Weekly milestones: Come up with color combinations and logos for homepage and courses page of the BirdSong: Dec 1, 2023 to Dec 7, 2023
- etc

4. Create an entire backlog of tasks related to the services of the BirdSong LMS
- Develop User registration process
- Develop User sign in page
- Develop payment service for the courses functionality
- Develop homepage for the logged in users
- Develop messaging functionality for the users
- etc

5. Assign Scrum master for different teams of the project



As a head developer, I would do the following

1. Generate class diagram(s) depicting the connection between different classes, use cases, parameters, methods and databases (sample class diagram for BirdSong LMS attached to the repo)

2. Further breakdown backlog tasks into subtasks and assign severity (high, medium, low) and type of issue (bug, feature, blocker) to the tasks
- Develop User registration process: i) Create user registration form (page) and check the user details for redundancy ii) Establish connection with the database and store details into db upon successful creation
- Develop homepage for the logged in users: i) Create reusable components to display paid courses and selected courses in a sliding fashion ii) Integrate other functionality such as messaging and avatar styling into the homepage iii) Add logout functionality for the user from dropdown button
- etc

3. Help/Guide PM in selecting the tech stack for the project based on the necessities of the clients/requirements
- For frontend based applications, having a responsive and user friendly UI is necessary. React is a choice
- For unstructured data in the db, select NoSQL for the database. MongoDB is a choice
- etc

3. Conduct as/assist scrum master in sprint planning by
- Selecting tasks from the backlog for the sprint week based on sequence of implementation
    -Task 1: Generate database schema for the users
    -Task 2: Generate database schema for the courses
    -Task 3: Generate secure Authentication and Authorization methods for log-in functionality
    -Task 4: Generate API calls to fetch database details to the frontend
    -etc
- Scoping tasks for time required to finish the tasks
    -Task 1: 20h
    -Task 2: 16h

    -etc
- Assigning tasks to co-developers/team mates based on their availability, experience, and area of expertise
- Conduct review and retrospective meetings to assses what has been achieved and what needs to be improved
- Conduct daily standups to let know status of developers each day
- etc

4. Perform code reviews for the team and help junior devs in following coding standards to improve

5. Ensure development phase matches the overall project timeline and causes no issues to the release dates

6. Look into new bugs identified by the QA and assign them the severity, emergency, and resolve them

7. Maintain and record documentation for all processes, functionality and versions of the BirdSong LMS
- Documentation for the code side logic and explanation
- Documentation for the guide through processes of the services provided by the BirdSong
- etc
